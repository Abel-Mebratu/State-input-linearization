# State-input-linearization
State-input linearization is a technique that transforms a nonlinear system into a linear one by applying state and input transformations. This simplifies both the analysis and control of complex nonlinear systems, allowing the use of standard linear control methods such as pole placement.

#Key Concepts: 
- Nonlinear System: Many real-world systems, such as robotic arms and aircraft, exhibit nonlinear behavior, which can make them difficult to control directly.
- Linearization: By transforming the system's states and control inputs, nonlinear dynamics can be approximated as a linear system around a desired operating point.
- Feedback Linearization: A specific form of linearization where the nonlinear system is transformed through feedback control, enabling the design of controllers 
 based on linear system theory.
# How it Works:

- State Transformation: Nonlinear state variables are mapped to a new set of state variables that are easier to control. 
- Input Transformation: The control input is adjusted to cancel out nonlinearities, resulting in a linear relationship between the transformed state and control input. 
- Linear Control Application: After transformation, linear control techniques are applied to the resulting system to achieve desired performance, such as stability, fast response, or minimal overshoot.
# Applications:
State-input linearization is widely used in fields such as:
 - Robotic Control: Where complex interactions between actuators and sensors can be simplified.
 - Aerospace Systems for controlling the dynamics of aircraft, spacecraft, and drones with nonlinear aerodynamic forces.
